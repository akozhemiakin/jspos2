**Project is in the early stage of development**

The main goal of this project is to create simple JavaScript client to work with Shtrikh-M
(Russian scales manufacturer http://www.shtrih-m.ru/) scales which use POS2 protocol. This project
is in the very early stage of development and tested only with Shtrikh-Slim scales. For now the client is
able to connect to scales and receive current weight channel state. Also it allows to easily send raw
commands (thus allowing to send any other command that is not natively supported by this library yet),
taking care of LRC calculation and other boring stuff. 

More detailed documentation is on the way.
