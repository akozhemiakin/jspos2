**Project is in the early stage of development**

The main goal of this project is to create simple JavaScript client to work with Shtrikh-M
(Russian scales manufacturer http://www.shtrih-m.ru/) scales which use POS2 protocol. This project
is in the very early stage of development and tested only with Shtrikh-Slim scales. For now the client is
able to connect to scales and receive current weight channel state.

More detailed documentation is on the way.
